In this feature college authority can search a student based on their required quality. For example, in a function college authority need a student who has good public speking quality. The admin/support simply go to this window, Search good public speaking quality, all the students who has that strengths will be shown in a table with all details like who give him feedbacks, count of that feedback etc. And definetly the table data will be shorted from the best student based on feedback to less good student for that searching parameter,  in this example 'Good public speaking quality'. We will use <strong><i>Complex Query </i></strong> to get the result. To achive the goal, one window will be provided to the admin and support which contain: <br /></span>

This content of report or suggestion will be generated by<strong><i> Generative AI </i></strong>  after analysing the feedbacks he/she get. This analysis will be done by default with the last 12 months data of a teacher and all previous data of a student. The feature will be like below. There will be three sections of the report: <br /> </span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">a.	 Areas, which need improvement: Based on feedbacks also with “additional comments” there will be multiple points that on which things the user need to work now to make it better. This result will be generated after analysing all the rating parameters not only “Areas of improvement” parameters. This may farther classify as:</span>
                            <span className="mx-5 d-block">i.	Very weak areas</span>
                            <span className="mx-5 d-block">ii.	Weak areas </span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">b.	Strong areas: Based on feedbacks also with “additional comments” there will be multiple points that are good enough of the user and must be maintain like this. This may include a feature: Points the strengths which became better from the previous feedbacks. This will be done by a comparisons analysis of old and new feedbacks.</span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">c.	Conclusion: The final conclusion in 2 to 3 lines about his growth and future steps he/she should take. </span>

                        <span><strong>3. Slang words recongnization: </strong>There will be a system which will monitor all the manual inputes like "Strength", "Area of Improvement" & "Additional Comments" and check by algorithms that any one is giving any unwanted input or slang inputs or not. The whole task was done by <strong><i>AI & ML</i></strong> . If there is any that will be informed to EduInsight Admin and also the college admin by a new window. For that there will be a Eduinsight Admin portal or dashboard. The steps of the process will be like below: <br /> </span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">a.	If any student or teacher do such activity College admin or Eduinsight admin will get notified. And that feedback will be stored in pending Feedback area.</span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">b.	If College admin or Eduinsights admin allow that feedback to be submitted only then the feedback will submited.</span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">c.	If the admin thought it is not a submitable feedback the admin either give his/her a warning that will be notified to that user also that will recoded in DB. Or admin can directly block that user in the application.</span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">d.	If the user is an anonymous student then his/her identity will be reveled to admin performe the whole process.</span>
                        <span className="mx-3 d-block">e.	If the user will be blocked then he was merked as rejected user and the reson will be given by admin on the time of blocking. </span>

                    <span><strong>4. Dynamic feedback parameters: </strong> There will be a section for create, update, delete parameters for feedback form. All the parameter will be dynamic and admin can add or remove or edit any parameter and it's options as per his/her requrement. Also admin can set the input box type as per requrement like dropdown, input box, multiselect input box, toggle etc. <br /> </span>
